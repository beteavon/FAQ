# How do I buy a subscription while using the TestFlight beta?

Payments made through the beta version don’t actually go through — I don’t receive anything from them.  
To purchase a subscription, install the App Store version over your current TestFlight build. You won’t lose any data, but please note: your accounts are your responsibility.  

Your spot in the beta will be saved, so you can return to the TestFlight version anytime after a successful purchase.
