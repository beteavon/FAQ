**Where can I download Swiftgram?**

You can install Swiftgram from the App Store or try the beta via TestFlight: [beta.swiftgram.app](https://beta.swiftgram.app/).  
The app is *not* available as a downloadable `.ipa` file.  
If you found one somewhere — it’s not official. That’s a third-party modification we have nothing to do with.
