# How does Session Backup work?

Swiftgram lets you back up your sessions to the encrypted Apple Keychain — which stays intact even if you reinstall the app or restore your OS from an encrypted backup.  

This means you won’t lose your accounts after reinstalling Swiftgram.

Backups never leave your device.  
⚠️ Only *active* sessions are backed up. If you log out or your session is remotely revoked (including by Telegram itself), it can’t be restored.
