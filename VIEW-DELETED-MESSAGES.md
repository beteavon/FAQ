# Can I view deleted messages?

No, you can’t. Such features aren’t allowed by Telegram’s Terms of Service and would get Swiftgram removed from the App Store.

[Section 1.4](https://core.telegram.org/api/terms):
> It is forbidden to interfere with the basic functionality of Telegram. This includes but is not limited to: making actions on behalf of the user without the user's knowledge and consent, preventing self-destructing content from disappearing, preventing last seen and online statuses from being displayed correctly, tampering with the 'read' statuses of messages (e.g. implementing a 'ghost mode'), preventing typing statuses from being sent/displayed, etc.
