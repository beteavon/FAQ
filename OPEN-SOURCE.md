**Is Swiftgram really open-source?**

Yes â€” the entire Swiftgram codebase is open-source, including the Pro features. You can check it out at [source.swiftgram.app](https://source.swiftgram.app).  

We believe openness and transparency are core values. If you trust the project and like what it offers, supporting the author is one of the best ways to help it grow.
