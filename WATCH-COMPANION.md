**Is Swiftgram available on Apple Watch?**

Yes, a Classic Watch Companion is available in Swiftgram. It offers basic support for Apple Watch, including:

• Sending text and voice messages  
• Quick replies  
• Location sharing  
• Recent static stickers  
• Reading recent chats and messages  
• Listening to voice messages  
• Viewing low-quality images and opening videos on iPhone

This version is based on the old Telegram companion app and does not support features like animated stickers, reactions, or forums. It may contain some bugs and won’t receive active updates — a full rewrite would be required to improve it significantly.

Still, it can be useful for Apple Watch users until Telegram offers an official alternative.
