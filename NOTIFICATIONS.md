# Notification issues

Getting "You have a new message" or don't receive notifications at all? Make sure you've enabled notifications and previews in system and in the app. Yes, it sounds absurd, but in 9 out of 10 reports people forget they've disabled the notifications.

If **you're sure** notifications are enabled, try one of the following:

1. Disable and re-enable notifications in [iOS Settings > Apps > Swiftgram](sg://sg/ios_settings)
2. Reboot your device

or

1. Go to [Debug Menu](sg://sg/debug) (10 quick taps on Settings/Avatar icon) and use **Reset Notifications**
2. Reboot your device
