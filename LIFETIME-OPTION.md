**I hate subscriptions. Is there a lifetime option?**

No, and here's why: Swiftgram has recurring costs — Apple Developer account, infrastructure, a powerful Mac to compile builds quickly — and I spend time adapting to Telegram’s frequent updates to make sure everything works smoothly.  

A one-time payment can’t fairly cover ongoing work. Even a large upfront fee would eventually stop breaking even. That’s why Swiftgram uses a subscription model — it reflects the real, ongoing effort behind it.
