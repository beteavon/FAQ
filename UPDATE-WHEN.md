# When Swiftgram update?

Swiftgram is a [fork](https://source.swiftgram.app/) (clone) of an official app, It depends on a public [source code](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS/tags) availabiliy. Expect Swiftgram update after Telegram will publish latest sources.

This is how typical update looks like

1. Telegram publishes update to AppStore
2. Telegram publishes source code to GitHub
3. I need to stop anything I'm doing and pick-up latest code changes
4. Solving all code conflicts to keep existing Swiftgram features working
5. Uploading to [beta.swiftgram.app](https://beta.swiftgram.app) and waiting for Apple to approve new version in TestFlight
6. Checking your feedback in chats. Major update issues are discovered within one day
7. Sending Swiftgram to Apple App Store Review. If review was smooth, you will be able to download new version in [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6471879502?pt=126511626&ct=faq&mt=8)!
